# CV Generator

The point of this project is to be able to generate resumees easily, I often realize that I need to update my CV using remote tools like canvas, I also need to add more lines in my education/job history which is annoying to do at hand

The objective here is to have *all* relevant information structured inside a single xml file  
The I would be able to generate a CV in any format (HTML, latex, pdf, ...) by specifying not only a specific layout file but also the data relevant for the specific job offer:  
For instance: Cut off parts of my job history, highlight specific skills, hide useless skills etc
